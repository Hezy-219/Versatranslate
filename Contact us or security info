## Reporting a Vulnerability,
To report a vulnerability, contact us at vulnerability.report.maximillian@gmail.com, who knows, you will get a shoutout in our 
contributors list(something coming up).
Most probable erros are value errors (which we've handled), unnecessary lines of code(we love doing this, kind of our specialty), missing necessary except
blocks and so on.
Vulenerability category levels:
value errors : Low-Level
Bugs like code not responding: Medium level(report as soon as possible).
Prompts to download something : High level(report via email directly and immediately, our codes use mostly inbuilt modules or libraries Note: a liabrary getting downloaded is different from a new software being downloaded
Also, send us an email if you want the code without loading aesthetics and you could send designs you think of and we may consider the design/feature and customize your codes we
does this incase we have beginners or newbies that want to use or app otherwise Our license allows you to do those customizaations you want.
Be sure to make any and every email clear and detailed. We make programs for everyone, well we simplify it enough for beginners to understand.
We will try our best to respond within 48 hours because we got nothing else to do but listen. Thank you for using our code.

## Next update
